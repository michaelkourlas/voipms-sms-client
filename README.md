## Overview ##

VoIP.ms SMS is an Android messaging app for VoIP.ms that seeks to replicate the
aesthetic of [Android Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging).

## Rationale ##

A number of people use VoIP.ms as a cheaper alternative to subscribing to a
voice plan for their mobile devices.

Unfortunately, this can make sending text messages rather difficult, as the
[VoIP.ms SMS Message Center](https://voip.ms/m/sms.php) is clearly built as a 
diagnostic tool for use in desktop browsers, not as an easy way to send and
receive messages on a mobile device. 

VoIP.ms does provide a [mobile version](https://sms.voip.ms/) of this interface 
with an improved UI, but it still lacks important features that are only 
possible with a dedicated app.

## Features ##

* Clean material design aesthetic based on that of Android Messages, Google's 
  standard messaging app for Android
* Push notifications
* Synchronization with device contacts
* Message search
* Comprehensive support for synchronization with VoIP.ms
* Completely free

## Installation ##

The standard version of the application uses closed-source Firebase libraries 
to support push notifications and facilitate crash reporting and analytics, 
among other purposes. A version of the application that is completely open 
source is available from F-Droid.

Both versions are available from the [Releases section](https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases) 
of the GitHub repository.
